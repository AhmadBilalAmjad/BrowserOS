# The Open-source Agentic Browser 🦊
Nxtscape is the open-source **agentic browser** – your privacy-first alternative to closed-source browsers (like Arc, Comet). Built on Chromium, Nxtscape lets you run **Manus like agents** locally and automate the boring parts of using the web.

> **Looks like Chrome, but with AI superpowers.** 

We believe browsers must be **_open source_**, not owned by search or ad companies. And the future is AI agents automating your work **_locally and securely_**. We're building the best browser for that future. 

Nxtscape delivers five core features:
1. 🤖 **Local AI Agents.** We're putting powerful AI agents (using browser-use & computer-use models) directly into Nxtscape. Automate *any* boring workflow. It all runs on your machine! Your data stays private.
2. 🔒 **Privacy You Can Trust.** We're a browser, not a search‑ad company. Your history stays local. We don't want your data. We will also let you connect to Ollama and other local AI tools directly in your browser - get AI help without sending your data to the cloud / closed-source LLM providers.
3. 🚫 **Actually block ads.** Google has made ad blocking harder with Chrome's Manifest V3 update and blocked popular tools like uBlock Origin. We've made changes to the Chromium source code to restore true ad blocking power.
4. 🌍 **Open source forever.** Tired of companies abandoning their browsers (like Arc) or making big changes you hate? Nxtscape is open source - if we ever go in a direction you don't like, you or the community can fork the code and continue using what works for you.
5. ✨ **Familiar, But Better:** We're starting with the familiar Chromium base (so all your extensions work!), but we're adding superpowers without a steep learning curve.


## 🤔 Why a new Browser, Not Just an Extension?
Extensions are great, but they hit walls. To build the future we imagine, we need more control:

1. **Real Automation Needs Real Control:** Browser extensions are limited. To _truly_ let you automate tasks powerfully (think agentic automation), we need control over the browser's core. 
2. **A Truly Ad-Free, Private Web:** We want a web without annoying ads and trackers. Google is making this harder on Chrome with changes like Manifest V3, which hurt great ad blockers like uBlock Origin. By building our own browser, we can bake in **strong ad-blocking** from the start and ensure your browsing stays private. Your history stays local, on your machine.


## ✨ What Makes Nxtscape Different?
We know there are other browsers. Here's why Nxtscape stands out:

### Nxtscape vs Chrome
Chrome has gotten worse over time, not better. Google's business model depends on tracking you and showing ads. We've built a browser that actually respects your privacy and lets you browse without constant interruptions.
### Nxtscape vs Brave
We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs, and other projects. Nxtscape is **laser-focused** on building the best **AI-powered, productivity-focused, private browser**. We want to bring you latest AI features sooner, like **agentic automation and integrating MCP!**
### Nxtscape vs Arc
Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When the company abandoned it, users were left behind. That **will never happen** with Nxtscape. We are **100% open source**. If you don't like the direction we're going, you or the community can fork the code and build your own version. Power to the people!
### Nxtscape vs Perplexity Comet
Perplexity is a search company. Your browser history will likely be used for ad targeting eventually. We are **NOT** a search company. If you're switching from Chrome, choose a truly privacy-first browser instead of another data collector. Choose Nxtscape.

## The Vision: A Browser That Works For You 💡
We spend so much time in our browsers, but they haven't really changed much. We're drowning in tabs, repetitive tasks, and information overload. Nxtscape aims to fix that. Imagine a browser that:

- Summarizes your feeds (Twitter, HN, etc.) so you see what matters.
- Helps you manage tabs intelligently.
- Lets you find anything you've seen before instantly.
- Automates the boring stuff.
- Protects your privacy fiercely.

That's the future we're building with Nxtscape.
