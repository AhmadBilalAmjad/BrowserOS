# The Open-source Agentic Browser.
Nxtscape ("next-scape") is an open-source **agentic browser** – your privacy-first alternative to closed-source browsers (like Arc, Dia, Perplexity Comet). Built on Chromium, Nxtscape lets you run **Manus like agents** locally and boost your productivity with an AI-sidekick.

We'd love to hear what problems you'd like to see solved! Share your ideas through our [anonymous form](https://dub.sh/nxtscape-feature-request).

# **Looks like Chrome, but with AI superpowers.**

We believe the future is AI agents automating your work, and we want to be the **_open source browser_** that can do it **_locally and securely_** instead of sending your data to a search or ad company. 

## The Vision: A Browser That Works For You 💡
We spend half our lives in browsers, but they haven't really evolved. We're drowning in tabs, doing the same tasks over and over, and losing track of what we've seen. Nxtscape changes that. Imagine a browser that:

- Manages your tabs with AI - groups them, closes the old ones, keeps you organized
- Finds anything you've seen before instantly ("that article about AI I read last week")
- Automates repetitive tasks - let agents do the boring stuff while you focus on what matters
- Guards your privacy like a watchdog - your data stays yours, always

That's not just a vision. That's what we're building with Nxtscape. Join [our waitlist](https://nxtscape.ai), we'll send you the download link soon!

## 🤔 Why a new Browser, Not Just an Extension?
Extensions are great, but they hit walls. To build the future we imagine, we need more control:

1. **Real Automation Needs Real Control:** Browser extensions are limited. To _truly_ let you automate tasks powerfully (think agentic automation), we need control over the browser's core. 
2. **A Truly Ad-Free, Private Web:** We want a web without annoying ads and trackers. Google is making this harder on Chrome with changes like Manifest V3, which hurt great ad blockers like uBlock Origin. By building our own browser, we can bake in **strong ad-blocking** from the start and ensure your browsing stays private. Your history stays local, on your machine.


## ✨ What Makes Nxtscape Different?
We know there are other browsers. Here's why Nxtscape stands out:

### Nxtscape vs Chrome
While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, the Chrome browser hasn't evolved much over the last 10 years and it lacks meaningful AI features (agentic automation, MCP support, ...). 

### Nxtscape vs Brave
We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs, and other projects. Nxtscape is **laser-focused** on building the best **AI-powered, productivity-focused, private browser**. We want to bring you latest AI features sooner, like **agentic automation and integrating MCP!**

### Nxtscape vs Arc/Dia
Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When the company abandoned it, users were left behind. That **will never happen** with Nxtscape. We are **100% open source**. If you don't like the direction we're going, you or the community can fork the code and build your own version. Power to the people!

### Nxtscape vs Perplexity Comet
Perplexity is a search company. Your browser history will likely be used for ad targeting eventually. We are **NOT** a search company. If you're switching from Chrome, choose a truly privacy-first browser instead of another data collector. Choose Nxtscape.
